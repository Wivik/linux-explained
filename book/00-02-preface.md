## About the author

I'm Seb and I’ve discovered Linux in the early 2000s, with a first attempt to install Debian Linux on my computer, but after printing kilometers of documentation and trying to have the display working, I’ve finally gave up. A few times later, I’ve found a Linux magazine with three Mandrake 9.1 CD-ROM. That was my actual first experience with Linux until I’ve started using Ubuntu Linux with its first release in 2004.

On a more professional side, I’ve started to see Linux for servers in my second job, mainly Red Hat Enterprise Linux. I had also some AIX system under my scope. Since I was using this system for my personal computer, I became more and more enthusiast with itand after 20 years using it, I think I can write something about it. Today, I’m a solution architect working on the integration of CICD tools and process for business context and promoting the DevOps philosophy. And Linux-based systems remain my daily drivers.

## About this book

Linux Explained is addressed to beginners or newcomers to the Linux world. Additionally, if you also have some experience and want to develop your knowledge about what is Linux and its concepts, you’re welcome too ! This book will (try to) keep using simple words and explanation with the purpose of being the most accessible possible.

Linux Explained started as a series of articles I’ve wrote for my blog. Following this first publication, I had the idea to rewrite these articles to fit in a book. The original series is available at the following URL : https://blog.zedas.fr/tags/linux-explained/

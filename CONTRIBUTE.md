The diagrams are made with [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) using the following convention :

- A background frame filled with `#ced4da`
- Grouped items's background is `#868e96`
- When the diagram represents a decision workflow, the follow colors are used :
	+ `#868e96` for the first steps
	+ `#fd7e14`for the question steps
	+ `#fa5252` for the error steps
	+ `#40c057` for the success steps
- Ensure you name the arrows to ensure the colors may not confuse for black and white e-reading devices

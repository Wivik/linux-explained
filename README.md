# Linux Explained

*Linux Explained* is a series of articles I've published [on my blog](https://blog.zedas.fr/tags/linux-explained/) to help newcomers or beginners to Linux to discover and develop their knowledge about it.

Converted into an ebook, this repository contains the sources of the document and is opened to any contributions.

## How to use

Check the [latest release](https://github.com/Wivik/linux-explained/releases) for the current book's version. The `epub` file will be attached to it.

Just import the `linux-explain.epub` file into your favorite e-reader.
